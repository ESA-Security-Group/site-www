TODO: Talk about how to embed the Dart VM into existing environments.

I believe we have some content for this in https://www.dartlang.org/articles/server/native-extensions#using-the-dart-embedding-api-from-native-code.

We should also talk about how to integrate with hot-reload; explain to framework
developers how they can offer hot reload to their customers (see
https://github.com/angel-dart/hot for one such example).
