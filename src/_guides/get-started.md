Jump right in. Use the embedded DartPad below to play with Dart and to experience the language and core APIs.
DartPad is a quick and easy way to
become familiar with Dart language features
([more info](/tools/dartpad)).
You can also open [DartPad in a new window.]({{site.custom.dartpad.direct-link}}){:target="_blank"}

<iframe

    width="100%"
    height="310px"
    style="border: 1px solid #ccc;">
</iframe>

Note that DartPad supports only a few core libraries.
If you want to use other libraries,
such as dart:io or libraries from packages,
you'll need to download platform-specific tools.
